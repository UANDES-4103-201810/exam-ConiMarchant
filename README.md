# README

I would like to make clear that because of reasons that I wasn't able to understand, I
 couldn't run my seeds file, and because of that I wasn't able to develop much further
 my application. 
 But, I was able to:
 
 * Implement a shopping cart that would have worked if only my seeds file had run.
 * Implement a navigation bar, that permits returning to the homepage at any moment.
 
This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
